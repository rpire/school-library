# School Library Bug Finding

In the `Person` class, there seems to be a method that is not working as it is supposed to...

The `validate_name` method is supposed to:
- Make sure the first letter of the given person's name is a capital letter.
- Make sure that the name has a maximum of 10 characters. If it is longer it should trim the word.
- Validate and save the corrected name.

Can you find out where the bug is?

> You are allowed to change the code as you require to fix the bug. Happy coding!

## Getting Started
