# School Library

> This is a project from the third week of the fourth module of the Microverse Program.

In this project we learned how to work with classes following the 4 principles of Objec Oriented Programming. 3 different classes were created with different methods, `Person`, `Student`, and `Teacher`.

> Each of the classes was created in a different `rb` file.
